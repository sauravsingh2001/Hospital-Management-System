he Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive web-based application designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of hospital operations. Developed using PHP and MySQL, this system provides a robust platform for managing various aspects of healthcare administration, ensuring that medical facilities can focus on delivering high-quality patient care.

One of the core features of the HMS is Patient Management, which allows healthcare providers to record and manage detailed patient information, including personal details, medical history, and treatment records. This feature ensures that medical staff have quick access to vital patient data, facilitating informed decision-making and improving overall care.

The Appointment Scheduling module simplifies the process of booking and managing appointments for both patients and doctors. Patients can easily schedule, reschedule, or cancel appointments through a user-friendly interface, reducing wait times and enhancing patient satisfaction. This feature also helps healthcare providers optimize their schedules and manage their time effectively.

In addition, the HMS includes a Billing and Invoicing system that automates the billing process. It generates invoices for services rendered, tracks payments, and manages outstanding balances, ensuring accurate financial records and improving revenue cycle management. This feature is crucial for maintaining the financial health of the hospital.

The Inventory Management component allows hospitals to monitor the availability of medical supplies and equipment in real-time. It provides alerts for low stock levels and facilitates procurement processes, ensuring that essential items are always available for patient care.

Lastly, the system incorporates User Roles and Security features, implementing role-based access control to protect sensitive patient information. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access specific data, enhancing security and compliance with healthcare regulations.
